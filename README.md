2D Geometry Library: 

Point and LineSegment
Overview

This Python library provides a simple yet powerful set of classes for representing and manipulating points and line segments in a two-dimensional space. The core of the library consists of two classes: Point and LineSegment.

Point Class

The Point class represents a point in 2D space. Each Point object has two private data members, _x_coord and _y_coord, 
which store the x and y coordinates of the point, respectively. 
The class provides methods for initializing these coordinates, retrieving their values, and calculating the distance to another point.

LineSegment Class

The LineSegment class represents a line segment defined by two endpoints. Each LineSegment object contains two private data members, _endpoint_1 and _endpoint_2, each of which is a Point object. The class offers functionality to compute the length and slope of the line segment, as well as to determine if two line segments are parallel.

Features

Encapsulation and Data Hiding: Both Point and LineSegment classes encapsulate their data members, ensuring that direct access from outside the class is restricted, promoting data integrity and security.

Distance Calculation: 

The Point class includes a method distance_to that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.

Slope and Length Computation: 

The LineSegment class can compute its length based on the distance between its endpoints and determine its slope.

Parallelism Detection: 

The LineSegment class has a method is_parallel_to to check if two line segments are parallel, accounting for edge cases like vertical line segments and zero-length segments.

Usage

Creating Points and Line Segments

To use the library, create Point objects by passing the x and y coordinates to the constructor. Then, create LineSegment objects by passing two Point objects as the endpoints.

python code example: 

point_1 = Point(3, 4)

point_2 = Point(6, 8)

line_segment = LineSegment(point_1, point_2)

Calculating Distances, Lengths, Slopes, and Parallelism:

After creating Point and LineSegment objects, you can use the provided methods to perform various calculations:

Distance between Points:

python example code:

distance = point_1.distance_to(point_2)

Length of a Line Segment:

python example code:

length = line_segment.length()

Slope of a Line Segment:

python example code:

slope = line_segment.slope()

Check for Parallel Line Segments:

python example code:

is_parallel = line_segment_1.is_parallel_to(line_segment_2)

Edge Cases Handling

The library robustly handles edge cases:

Zero-Length Line Segments: A line segment with identical endpoints is treated as having zero length.

Vertical Line Segments: The slope for vertical line segments is defined as None.

Parallelism with Zero-Length and Vertical Segments: The parallelism logic correctly identifies parallel vertical line segments and considers zero-length segments not parallel to any other segment.

Conclusion

This 2D Geometry Library is an efficient and user-friendly tool for performing basic geometric operations in a 2D space. It's suitable for educational purposes, simple geometric computations, and as a building block for more complex geometric processing in Python applications.
